# React Template

**Use this template to get up and running quickly on projects.**

This is just like the webpack template. Use it, create the repo, connect it to your local and `npm i`.

## User Story 
CREATE
- As a user I should be able to enter a word and have the application populate a word web of associated words.

READ
- As a user I should be able to see all saved thoughts.
- Search bar functionality that will filter thoughts based on key words. 

UPDATE
- From there the user can branch off of those associations into a larger word web.

SAVE/DELETE
- As a user I want to be able to save and label my word webs in a collection as well as deleted them.

EXTRAS
- I want to bundle this application into my front end project where I made a open mic scheduler that would randomly generate the week's timeline for the user.
